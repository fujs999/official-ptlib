/** This class defines a thread-safe object in a collection.

  This is part of a set of classes to solve the general problem of a
  collection (eg a PList or PDictionary) of objects that needs to be a made
  thread safe. Any thread can add, read, write or remove an object with both
  the object and the database of objects itself kept thread safe.

  The act of adding a new object is simple and only requires locking the
  collection itself during the add.

  Locating an object is more complicated. The obvious lock on the collection
  is made for the initial search. But we wish to have the full collection lock
  for as short a period as possible (for performance reasons) so we lock the
  individual object and release the lock on the collection.

  A simple mutex on the object however is very dangerous as it can be (and
  should be able to be!) locked from other threads independently of the
  collection. If one of these threads subsequently needs to get at the
  collection (eg it wants to remove the object) then we will have a deadlock.
  Also, to avoid a race condition with the object begin deleted, the objects
  lock must be made while the collection lock is set. The performance gains
  are then lost as if something has the object locked for a long time, then
  another object wanting that object will actually lock the collection for a
  long time as well.

  So, an object has 4 states: unused, referenced, reading & writing. With the
  additional rider of "being removed". This flag prevents new locks from being
  acquired and waits for all locks to be relinquished before removing the
  object from the system. This prevents numerous race conditions and accesses
  to deleted objects.

  The "unused" state indicates the object exists in the collection but no
  threads anywhere is using it. It may be moved to any state by any thread
  while in this state. An object cannot be deleted (ie memory deallocated)
  until it is unused.

  The "referenced" state indicates that a thread has a reference (eg pointer)
  to the object and it should not be deleted. It may be locked for reading or
  writing at any time thereafter.

  The "reading" state is a form of lock that indicates that a thread is
  reading from the object but not writing. Multiple threads can obtain a read
  lock. Note the read lock has an implicit "reference" state in it.

  The "writing" state is a form of lock where the data in the object may
  be changed. It can only be obtained exclusively and if there are no read
  locks present. Again there is an implicit reference state in this lock.

  Note that threads going to the "referenced" state may do so regardless of
  the read or write locks present.

  Access to safe objects (especially when in a safe collection) is recommended
  to by the PSafePtr<> class which will manage reference counting and the
  automatic unlocking of objects ones the pointer goes out of scope. It may
  also be used to lock each object of a collection in turn.

  The enumeration of a PSafeCollection of PSafeObjects utilises the PSafePtr
  class in a classic "for loop" manner.

  <CODE>
    for (PSafePtr<MyClass> iter(collection, PSafeReadWrite); iter != NULL; ++iter)
      iter->Process();
  </CODE>

  There is one piece if important behaviour in the above. If while enumerating
  a specic object in the collection, that object is "safely deleted", you are
  guaranteed that the object is still usable and has not been phsyically
  deleted, however it will no longer be in the collection, so the enumeration
  will stop as it can no longer determine where in the collection it was.

  What to do in this case is to take a "snapshot" at a point of time that can be safely and completely
  iterated over:

  <CODE>
    PSafeList<MyClass> collCopy = collection;
    for (PSafePtr<MyClass> iter(callCopy, PSafeReadWrite); iter != NULL; ++iter)
      iter->Process();
  </CODE>

  There are two modes of safe pointer: one that is enumerating a collection;
  and one that is independent of the collection that the safe object is in.
  There are subtle semantics that must be observed in each of these two
  modes especially when switching from one to the other.

  NOTE: the PSafePtr will allow safe and mutexed access to objects but may not
  be thread safe itself! This depends on the base class being used. If the more

  across threads.
